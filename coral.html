            <h1>Corals</h1>
            <p>Creatures that often live in compact colonies. Climate change and destructive fishing techniques such as dynamite fishing and bottom trawling pose major threats to these creatures.</p>

As with all basket stars, this species has five-part symmetry, with all hairlike appendages originating from five central arms that repeatedly divide into the basket shape that gives the group its common name.</div></a></div>

                <div class="choise_title">Christmas Tree Worm</div><div class="img_content"><a href="#" class="choise"><img src="Images/christmas tree worm.jpeg"><div class="choise_desc">Its name comes from its spindly appearance, which is similar to a fir tree. Their crown-like structures protrude from their otherwise tube-like bodies, which are composed of radioles (hairs) extending from the spines. These appendages are used to catch dinner, usually microscopic plants and animals, that swim by in the water.</div></a></div>

In common with all corals, this species is closely related to anemones, jellyfish, and other members of the phylum Cnidaria. Corals living in deep water, such as cockscomb cup corals, do not rely on symbiotic algae to feed. However, they are filter feeders, obtaining all of their energy by catching individual plankton in the water that passes along deep-sea currents.</div></a></div>

A reef-building species of fast growth in the Caribbean, it is one of the most important reef-building species. Corals of this species were once among the most abundant on reefs throughout their range. Scientists consider it to be critically endangered today.</div></a></div>

                <div class="choise_title">Giant Barrel Sponge</div><div class="img_content"><a href="#" class="choise"><img src="Images/giant barrel sponge.jpg"><div class="choise_desc">A giant barrel sponge lives in coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters. This is one of the largest sponge species, growing to at least six feet (1.8 m) in length wherever it lives. Besides crabs and shrimps, its bowl-shaped body provides habitat for a multitude of other invertebrates (such as gobies, cardinalfishes, and other species). Giant barrel sponges, like all sponges, are attached to the reef surface and are unable to move. A glass-like skeleton is characteristic of this sponge species.</div></a></div>

They are predatory and are able to move (by crawling very slowly) in order to reduce competition with nearby individuals or to increase their chances of successfully reproducing.</div></a></div>

There are a number of species of anemonefish that inhabit this anemone, including the common clownfish.</div></a></div>

As with all corals, this species' relatives include anemones, jellyfishes, and other species in the Phylum Cnidaria. Different populations of this species utilize different methods of procuring food since this species exists in both shallow and deep waters.</div></a></div>
